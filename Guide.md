# Multi-Agent Disaster Response and Relief Coordination System
## Objective
Design and implement a decentralized multi-agent system using SPADE or JADE to simulate and optimize the coordination of relief efforts in response to a natural disaster. The system will involve various agents representing emergency responders, supply vehicles, shelters, and affected civilians, all working together to ensure effective resource allocation and assistance delivery.

## Problem Scenario
In the aftermath of a natural disaster (e.g., earthquake, hurricane, or flood), relief efforts must be organized efficiently to ensure that affected areas receive food, medical supplies, rescue services, and shelter. Traditional centralized disaster management systems often struggle to cope with real-time challenges such as rapidly changing conditions, road blockages, and communication breakdowns. A decentralized system with autonomous agents representing different entities can respond more flexibly and efficiently to changing conditions and resource constraints.

## Key Features of the Assignment

1. Responder Agents: These agents represent emergency response teams responsible for rescuing civilians, delivering medical aid, and assessing damage in affected areas. Responder agents must decide which locations to prioritize based on the urgency of needs and available resources.
2. Supply Vehicle Agents: These agents manage the delivery of resources (food, water, medical supplies) from centralized depots to affected regions or shelters. They should optimize routes, taking into account road conditions, traffic, and time-sensitive needs in various locations.
3. Shelter Agents: Shelter agents represent temporary shelters set up to house displaced civilians. They need to communicate with supply agents to request resources and with responder agents to coordinate the transportation of civilians to shelters.
4. Civilian Agents: Civilians are represented by agents in need of various forms of assistance (e.g., rescue, medical care, food, and shelter). These agents will signal their needs, which responder agents and shelters must address in a coordinated way.
5. Dynamic Disaster Environment: The system operates in a rapidly changing environment. Roadblocks may emerge, buildings may collapse, new areas may become affected, and communication may be unreliable. Agents must adapt to these dynamic conditions and reprioritize their tasks in real time.
6. Decentralized Coordination: Each agent operates independently but collaborates with others through communication and negotiation to achieve global goals, such as minimizing casualties and delivering resources efficiently. No central authority dictates how agents should operate.
7. Resource and Time Optimization: Agents must manage limited resources (e.g., fuel for vehicles, available medical supplies) and work within time constraints. For instance, medical aid must be delivered within a certain time frame to save lives, and supply vehicles must optimize their routes to serve the greatest number of people in the shortest time.
8. Collaboration and Negotiation: Agents must communicate and negotiate with one another to ensure that resources are allocated effectively. For example, responder agents might negotiate with supply vehicle agents to prioritize medical supply delivery, while shelter agents request food and water based on their current capacity.
9. Performance Metrics: The system should measure success based on:
- Number of civilians rescued
- Speed of resource delivery to affected areas
- Efficiency of resource use (minimizing waste and avoiding oversupply)
- System resilience in responding to new and unexpected events
  
## Suggested Development Phases:

### Week 1-2:

- **System Design**: Define the roles and interactions of different agents (responders, supply vehicles, shelters, civilians). Decide on communication protocols for resource requests, coordination, and status updates.
- **Basic Implementation**: Implement a simple version of the system with responder and civilian agents. Responder agents should respond to requests for help from civilian agents.

### Week 3:

- **Resource Management**: Introduce supply vehicle agents responsible for delivering resources (e.g., food, water, medical aid) to shelters and affected areas. Implement basic route optimization algorithms for supply agents.
- **Dynamic Environment**: Simulate dynamic conditions such as roadblocks or new disaster zones emerging over time. Agents should be able to reroute and adjust their priorities in response to these changes.

### Week 4:

- **Shelter Management**: Implement shelter agents that track their capacity (number of civilians they can accommodate) and request resources from supply vehicle agents based on their current needs.
- **Collaboration Mechanism**: Introduce protocols for collaboration and negotiation among agents. For example, responder agents can communicate with supply vehicle agents to prioritize deliveries to critical areas.

### Week 5:

- **Advanced Decision-Making**: Enhance agent behavior to handle complex decision-making, such as balancing resource allocation between multiple affected areas or deciding when to evacuate civilians versus delivering supplies.
- **System Resilience**: Implement mechanisms for agents to handle system failures or partial information (e.g., disrupted communication between agents). Agents should be able to continue operating with degraded information.

### Week 6:

- **User Interface and Visualization**: Create a user interface to visualize the disaster area, agent movements, resource allocation, and key metrics like rescue operations and supply delivery efficiency.
- **Testing and Performance Evaluation**: Test the system in various disaster scenarios, including different sizes of affected areas, varying severity levels, and dynamic events. Evaluate performance using the predefined metrics and fine-tune agent behavior.
